# AIS Soccer Training with AI
Final project for the Building AI course
## Summary
The project is about collecting data from best players in the world about their lifestyle, exercises, and nutritious regime.
## Background
Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?
This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* Getting rid of Training Schedules as it's a very time consuming process as it effects our daily routine and ruin it sometimes.
* Making different routines to be away from boring habits and make sure to continue the same level of fitness everyday.
## How is it used?
Everyday or week or month I waste a lot of my time scheduling my SON daily training and lifestyle routine. So I decided to create a solution that could be used by many teenagers and prepare them for the professional competition.

## Data sources and AI methods
My data is generated from best players daily routines were I do search and find such routines and apply it on teenagers with a little twisy to match portions with age difference.
## Challenges
My project will always miss the psychological aspect for the teenagers as its totally a different mindset for that I have to collaborate withspecial teenagers sychitrests to take a professional advice on how to deal with day-to-day issues.
## What next?
I think being part of the academic body of famous soccer clubs will make my projet grow and spark very fast as it will find the perfect soil to prosperity.
